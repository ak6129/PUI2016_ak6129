Global autocorrelation analysis (which asks the question as to whether the pattern displays clustering or not) displays 
polyfit for summer (0.64335490815356511, 4220.5552980795601) and for winter (0.66023249858156818, 1600.8324238675889).
Moranâ€™s I measures the global spatial autocorrelation. Thus, the I statistic for summer rides is 0.643 and for winter is 0.660
for this data, and has a very small p value. I statistics is not close to our expected value for summer rides and winter rides. 
Local autocorrelation analysis show the following hot and cold spots:

Number of Hotspots_summer: 188
Number of Coldspots_summer: 245

Number of Hotspots_winter: 192
Number of Coldspots_winter: 210

The difference between hot spots in two seasons is not significant, while difference in cold spots is visual.    

Group: Mona helped me and Maisha in the begining to understand season splitting formula.
